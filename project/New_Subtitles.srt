1
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:20,083
Frank! What the hell was that thing?

2
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,985
I don't know!

3
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,284
Run!

4
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:29,121
Chuck! Chuck!

5
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,770
No! No!

6
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:40,901
Someone help me!

7
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:44,604
There's something down here!

8
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:48,277
Get me out! Get me out! Help!

9
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:49,615
Help me!

10
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:04,770
Come on!

11
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:06,430
Come on!

12
00:01:32,304 --> 00:01:34,670
The beast is shrouded. Use the eye.

13
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:48,954
It has tasted flesh.

14
00:02:49,057 --> 00:02:51,617
We must not let it escape.

15
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:52,659
Agreed.

16
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:54,354
I will conceal our efforts.

17
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,732
What the hell?.

18
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:27,858
Lucy, the legs!

19
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:03,932
No beast has ever come this close
to the sanctum before.

20
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:07,241
Mordo, does this not concern you?.

21
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,211
The creature is dead.

22
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:13,651
I will leave the worrying to you.

23
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,826
What?.

24
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:39,616
He saw us?.

25
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:40,650
Yes.

26
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:41,651
Through your spell?.

27
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:44,188
It would appear so.

28
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:01,806
"DOCTOR STRANGE"

29
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:15,322
Dr. Strange, wait!

30
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,694
Doctor!

31
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,233
Dr. Strange.

32
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:24,462
Man, it's been chaos,
absolute chaos.

33
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,094
Maybe I should check
your phone battery,

34
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:27,934
because I left you several...

35
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,271
Well, anyway,
just a couple of patient files to go over.

36
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:32,072
Five minutes. Tops.

37
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:33,737
I'm only here for rounds, Cory.

38
00:07:35,183 --> 00:07:37,708
Uh, Miss Latansie, acute aphasia,

39
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,684
migraines, facial nerve paralysis.

40
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:41,755
Referred by the Third Street
clinic downtown.

41
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:43,222
Insurance?.

42
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:45,725
Well, their deductible's
fairly substantial, but...

43
00:07:45,828 --> 00:07:47,386
- Income?.
- Modest.

44
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:48,793
Okay, low, but...

45
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,231
Cory, you have screened
these cases, haven't you?.

46
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:52,392
Yes, but...

47
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:55,096
Would a medical journal
be interested in Miss Latansie?.

48
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:57,366
- No, but...
- Then neither am I.

49
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,237
You love your job, don't you?.

50
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:04,940
I'm living the dream.

51
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,930
Stephen, good.

52
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:22,594
When I saw Cory sulking out there,
I knew you were in.

53
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,102
Oliver.

54
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,262
What an unexpected pleasure.

55
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:26,840
Please, sit down.

56
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:27,931
How's the grind?.

57
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:31,177
Turning me into hamburger.

58
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,337
What can I do to help?.

59
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:33,938
Seriously?.

60
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,176
Absolutely.

61
00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:37,115
Good, because as you know,

62
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,777
part of my job as administrator

63
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:41,789
is to keep this hospital
running smoothly.

64
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:44,292
So it helps if members
of my senior staff

65
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:48,057
aren't trying to, uh,
strangle one another.

66
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,326
And?.

67
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:51,368
People want to strangle you, Stephen.

68
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:53,369
Dr. Atwater for one.

69
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:55,030
She's been to see me again.

70
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,303
That woman has issues.

71
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,877
Yes, she does.

72
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,344
And they're all with you.

73
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:06,249
Look, I know you two
have a personal history...

74
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:08,913
Oliver, that has nothing
to do with this.

75
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:10,923
Fine.

76
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:14,426
But she calls you to the coma ward
for consults, you ignore her,

77
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:16,553
she rattles my cage, I rattle yours...

78
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:20,761
Please, let's just...
stop the dance, Stephen.

79
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:25,063
Okay. I promise I'll schedule her in.

80
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:27,574
She's waiting for you now.

81
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:29,042
Perfect.

82
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:48,927
I can't believe it.

83
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:52,471
The great Dr. Strange
has descended from his lofty tower

84
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:53,834
to slum in the coma ward.

85
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,135
Don't get used to it.

86
00:09:56,243 --> 00:09:59,838
This hospital didn't hire me
to handle ordinary cases.

87
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,505
I almost forgot how grumpy you get

88
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:03,743
when you miss your morning
coffee and colonic.

89
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:06,513
Let me clarify
the economics for you, Gina.

90
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:09,056
Sensational patients
bring recognition.

91
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,716
Recognition brings money,

92
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:13,021
and money keeps
Wellhaven's doors open.

93
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:15,358
You should be thanking me.

94
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:17,592
Oh, Stephen.

95
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,362
What happened to you?.

96
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,369
Don't you care anymore?.

97
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:23,940
Caring is not a luxury I can afford.

98
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,100
I get the hopeless cases, remember?.

99
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,768
I know.

100
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,506
That's why I need you.

101
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:32,811
The patient's name is Camille.

102
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:34,977
Gina, she's 12.

103
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:38,079
Yeah, I know you don't treat children,

104
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:40,853
but this is a special case.

105
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,020
Mrs. Carranza, this is Dr. Strange...

106
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,860
one of the world's
finest neurosurgeons

107
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:48,230
and a specialist in
aberrant brain maladies.

108
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,441
What symptoms did she present
prior to losing consciousness?.

109
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:57,033
She had nightmares.

110
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:59,706
That's unfortunate,
but I'm not a dreamreader.

111
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:01,305
Stephen, please.

112
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:04,318
Gina, these are my tools.

113
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,480
She needs a psychoanalyst,
not a surgeon.

114
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,887
It's not just nightmares.

115
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:09,151
It's her brain.

116
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,819
Look. This was taken seven days ago.

117
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:12,827
An embolism.

118
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,160
And this was taken this morning.

119
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,996
That's right.
Eight more in one week.

120
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:20,002
I've never seen anything like this.

121
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,367
Well, I have.

122
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:35,383
Something's going on in there.

123
00:11:50,473 --> 00:11:51,940
Camille?. Camille.

124
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,030
Can you hear me?.

125
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:55,906
The nightmares.

126
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:57,913
What... what did she see?.

127
00:11:58,015 --> 00:11:59,209
What?.

128
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:01,682
What did she see in her nightmares?.

129
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:02,752
A face.

130
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:05,288
She always saw a burning face.

131
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,256
So that's it?.

132
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,883
Children in mysterious comas

133
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,862
don't make the grade
for the great Dr. Strange?.

134
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,867
I am sick of this hospital
feeding your monster ego.

135
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,302
It's time you start giving back.

136
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,597
No! No!

137
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:26,945
I'm sorry.

138
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:29,073
I can't help you.

139
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:30,115
- Oh!
- Sorry.

140
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,299
Lipstick?.

141
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:19,999
Since when does my
little sister wear lipstick?.

142
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:22,008
Hey, give it back, moron.

143
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,374
Aw, come on.
I just want to help you.

144
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,539
Get away from me!

145
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:29,117
Oh, admit it. You look way better.

146
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:30,344
You are so dead.

147
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,188
Get off of me!

148
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,417
No!

149
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:42,623
April! You okay?.

150
00:13:43,768 --> 00:13:44,700
April.

151
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:09,220
In today's top story,

152
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:11,765
the third tornado this month
strikes the city

153
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:13,060
in an escalation of violent...

154
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,139
And in other news,

155
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:25,612
the fate of two city workers
remains a mystery

156
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,115
as an unexplained blast...

157
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:55,983
Stephen?.

158
00:15:57,821 --> 00:15:59,584
Here. Have some water.

159
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:02,523
The children...

160
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,059
What?.

161
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,287
The ones in the road.

162
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:07,364
Did I... hit any of them?.

163
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,899
Stephen, there weren't
any children.

164
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,697
Witnesses say you just lost control.

165
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,567
No, I...

166
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,038
but I saw...

167
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,336
You've been under for three days.

168
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,242
You're just a little confused.

169
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,611
Good news is
you're going to be okay.

170
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,279
Three days?.

171
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,291
Oh, God.

172
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:38,629
I want to see my chart.

173
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:39,701
I really think...

174
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:40,928
Show it to me.

175
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:45,098
Show it to me now.

176
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:05,861
Listen, Stephen,

177
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:09,024
nothing is absolute
in the world of medicine.

178
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:11,296
You know that.

179
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:12,962
Save it.

180
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:15,165
I'll be lucky if can open a door,

181
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:16,800
let alone hold a scalpel.

182
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,072
You're still a doctor,

183
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,877
and you don't need a scalpel
to heal people.

184
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:24,975
You think I had this coming,
don't you?.

185
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,917
Stephen, please.

186
00:17:27,022 --> 00:17:28,011
Just go.

187
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,898
Pardon me.

188
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:59,754
Wonderful to see you again,
Dr. Strange.

189
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:07,927
Would you like assistance
getting into your residence?.

190
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:09,434
No.

191
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:31,452
There you are, sir.

192
00:18:31,562 --> 00:18:33,325
Let me know
if you need anything else.

193
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,428
Oliver, there's got to be someone.

194
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:10,437
There's always someone
who will take your money, Stephen,

195
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:14,475
but that doesn't qualify them
to treat your hands.

196
00:19:14,577 --> 00:19:15,942
I'll take that chance!

197
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:18,776
I don't care how experimental
or how expensive.

198
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:21,443
I need some options.

199
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:23,486
Please.

200
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:25,282
Help me.

201
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,692
All right.

202
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,728
I've heard of a doctor in Berlin.

203
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:34,060
Why don't you start there?.

204
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:44,075
The procedure is very expensive.

205
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:51,949
We can see you six weeks from now.

206
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:53,953
"NEW STRIDES IN THE FIELD
OF NERVE REATTACHMENT"

207
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,333
Sorry, but the damage is too severe.

208
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:10,002
There is a specialist:

209
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,599
very good, but very expensive.

210
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,046
I am afraid we can't extend
your bill any further, sir.

211
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,582
We must have
the payment now.

212
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:29,091
Regrettably, Doctor,
your credit has been declined.

213
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,363
I'm sorry, Stephen,

214
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:39,735
but Oliver is still unavailable.

215
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:43,242
I'm sure he'll call you back
the first chance he gets.

216
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:53,079
There's just nothing we can do.

217
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,452
We've done all we can.

218
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:55,718
The damage is too severe.

219
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,191
The damage is too severe.
I'm sorry.

220
00:20:57,294 --> 00:20:58,352
You're out of options.

221
00:20:58,462 --> 00:20:59,360
Out of options.

222
00:20:59,463 --> 00:21:00,361
Nothing we can do.

223
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:01,557
There's nothing we can do.

224
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,133
- Nothing.
- Nothing we can do.

225
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:04,826
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

226
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:41,402
What?.

227
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:43,308
Dr. Strange.

228
00:21:43,414 --> 00:21:45,109
Who's there?.

229
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:49,653
I am Wong.

230
00:21:49,753 --> 00:21:51,186
How do you know my name?.

231
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,587
I know a great deal about you...

232
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:55,523
what you have been through

233
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:59,358
and what you are attempting to do now.

234
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:02,093
Do not lose hope, Dr. Strange,

235
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,567
for healing awaits you.

236
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,728
Where?.

237
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:06,897
In Tibet.

238
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:08,440
Tibet?.

239
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,373
How am I supposed to get there?.

240
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:11,910
I have nothing.

241
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:15,140
You have all that is needed,

242
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,411
and this will guide you there.

243
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:23,925
Why are you helping me?.

244
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:43,913
Gina.

245
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,550
Wait! Gina.

246
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:47,778
Don't be frightened.

247
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:50,821
Stephen?. Are you all right?.

248
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:52,653
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

249
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,317
I just...

250
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:55,724
I need your help.

251
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:57,660
What is it?.

252
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:59,596
I have to get to Tibet.

253
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,930
Why in the world would you...

254
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:03,094
Please.

255
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:04,933
I'm begging you.

256
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,414
Okay.

257
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,246
What do you need?.

258
00:24:56,132 --> 00:24:57,929
I made it.

259
00:24:58,034 --> 00:25:00,127
One journey ends...

260
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:03,365
as another begins.

261
00:25:09,414 --> 00:25:12,110
This way. It is not much further.

262
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:14,310
Where are we going?.

263
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,980
All questions will
be answered shortly.

264
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:27,361
Do as I do.

265
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:28,992
Who is this?.

266
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:32,105
The Ancient One.

267
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:41,843
How long must I wait?.

268
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:43,384
Be patient.

269
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:48,288
An audience with the sorcerer supreme
is an honor that cannot be rushed.

270
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:49,824
Please.

271
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:52,389
I've come so far.

272
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:53,725
Step back.

273
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:59,031
All I want is the cure
I was promised.

274
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:02,801
You can only heal
the wounds of the flesh

275
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:06,105
once you have healed
the wounds of the soul.

276
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:07,839
Spiritual guidance?.

277
00:26:09,482 --> 00:26:11,916
That's what you're offering?.

278
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:14,920
But he told me
you could fix my hands.

279
00:26:15,022 --> 00:26:16,751
I cannot.

280
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:19,189
For the cure you seek is within you.

281
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:20,727
I don't understand.

282
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:25,198
Then you have made this journey in vain.

283
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:30,704
Wait!

284
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:36,105
Please...

285
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:38,044
I've tried everything.

286
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:40,514
No. You have not.

287
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:44,314
The question is, are you willing to?.

288
00:26:44,422 --> 00:26:45,753
Yes.

289
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:50,989
Then you may stay.

290
00:26:51,096 --> 00:26:53,155
Thank you.

291
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:54,289
Come.

292
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,411
But where am I
supposed to sleep?.

293
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:14,554
Here.

294
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:16,385
On the floor?.

295
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:20,325
Comfort is a privilege,
one that is earned.

296
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:25,060
You start work in the morning.

297
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,067
You look nervous.

298
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:32,802
I have never faced
these creatures before.

299
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:34,139
Well, relax.

300
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:35,941
Shadowhounds are nothing.

301
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:37,241
I've killed dozens of 'em.

302
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:38,407
What has happened?.

303
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:40,643
Shadowhounds.

304
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:41,811
I will accompany you.

305
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:45,254
Oh?. And what of your duties
as nursemaid?.

306
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:48,486
Even when I was
your nursemaid, Mordo,

307
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:51,792
I still accomplished
all that was required of me.

308
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,147
Stay in the light.

309
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:11,186
That is where they are most vulnerable.

310
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:13,688
I do not see them.

311
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,351
They hunt in shadow
and in great numbers.

312
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,951
How do we lure them out?.

313
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:21,361
We already have.

314
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,436
Spread out!

315
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:39,545
Adena!

316
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:35,878
Where are you?.

317
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,248
Show yourselves, you vermin!

318
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,278
Oh, there you are.

319
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,857
Come on, then!

320
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:52,628
what are they doing?.

321
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:53,930
Gathering.

322
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:55,767
And so we wait.

323
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:59,309
When we can smell their breath,
only then do we strike.

324
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:02,144
Prepare yourselves.

325
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:15,261
Hello?.

326
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:16,659
Wong?.

327
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:19,189
Excuse me.

328
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,358
I, uh...

329
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,197
I was told to begin work
this morning.

330
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:24,703
Then you may begin.

331
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:26,865
You want me to scrub the floor?.

332
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:31,139
I would do it, but I am an old man.

333
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,237
I don't understand.

334
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:36,682
How am I supposed
to hold the brushes?.

335
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:40,847
That is between you
and the brushes.

336
00:30:58,144 --> 00:31:00,009
Where are the others?.

337
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:04,607
They fought bravely,
but were lost, Ancient One.

338
00:31:07,354 --> 00:31:10,255
the creatures move
with increasing confidence.

339
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:13,020
They seek their master,

340
00:31:13,128 --> 00:31:17,155
and Dormammu's influence
grows stronger by the day.

341
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:18,790
How is that possible?.

342
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:20,926
I have seen the gateway.

343
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:23,197
The dark dimension remains sealed.

344
00:31:23,305 --> 00:31:25,466
Dormammu has not come through.

345
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:31,013
Yes, but I fear
he knows something we do not.

346
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:14,424
- Doctor...
- Please.

347
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,895
She will not survive without surgery.

348
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,991
And there's little hope
that she'll survive with it.

349
00:32:19,102 --> 00:32:20,831
Let me tell you something.

350
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:23,065
Hope is the only thing
keeping her together.

351
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,506
I'm not letting you take that away.

352
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,003
What'd he say?.

353
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,374
Forget him.

354
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,414
He's not the right doctor for you.

355
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:33,985
You've said that about the last three.

356
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:35,713
Listen to me, April.

357
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,450
We're gonna wait six months.

358
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:41,686
By then, I'll be your doctor,

359
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:43,922
and we'll deal with this once and for all.

360
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,362
You're gonna be my doctor?.

361
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:47,900
Oh, man.

362
00:32:48,002 --> 00:32:50,402
Now I'm really in trouble.

363
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:54,205
Wait until you get my bill.

364
00:34:08,527 --> 00:34:13,191
Look, I don't know why you think
this is helping me,

365
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:15,096
because it isn't!

366
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:18,534
My hands... are getting worse!

367
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,665
They should not be
the measure of your progress.

368
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:23,106
What is, then?.

369
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,404
It isn't the wall.

370
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:26,138
You guys keep rebuilding it.

371
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:28,738
Just tell me.

372
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,580
When can I use these again?.

373
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:34,246
This is not about your hands.

374
00:34:34,357 --> 00:34:35,585
It never has been.

375
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:37,283
Listen to me.

376
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:38,690
I am a doctor!

377
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:40,261
I need my hands!

378
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:42,889
No. You do not.

379
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:51,431
Then there's no reason
for me to be here.

380
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:57,276
Let him go.

381
00:34:57,383 --> 00:35:01,444
But, Ancient One, he will not survive.

382
00:35:01,553 --> 00:35:03,783
That is his choice.

383
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:09,522
In the end, he must find
his own way back.

384
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,470
Okay, April,

385
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:52,703
You should be feeling
a little more relaxed.

386
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:54,473
I'm not scared.

387
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:55,741
And you shouldn't be.

388
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,476
Because I'm gonna
take care of you.

389
00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:59,814
How do I look?.

390
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,320
You could use some more lipstick.

391
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:05,725
Okay, we're ready.

392
00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:07,226
Now, when you wake up,

393
00:36:07,328 --> 00:36:09,796
you'll feel a little groggy,

394
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:12,662
but you'll be all better.

395
00:36:15,171 --> 00:36:16,661
I am scared.

396
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:19,241
April, you're gonna be fine.

397
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:20,934
I promise.

398
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:47,372
No!

399
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:56,244
Love...

400
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:57,613
loss...

401
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,153
pain.

402
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:05,216
They are stones in the wall
that block your path, Stephen.

403
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:08,421
What... Are you...

404
00:37:08,532 --> 00:37:10,557
Are you really here?.

405
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:13,431
See the wall for what it is,

406
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:15,904
and then tear it down,

407
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:17,907
for the truth is waiting.

408
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:18,907
What truth?.

409
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,411
That your sister
could not be saved.

410
00:37:22,514 --> 00:37:24,072
How can you say that?.

411
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:25,979
She died on my table.

412
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:27,176
She trusted me!

413
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:33,147
you are a natural healer, Stephen,

414
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:36,990
but not all lives
are destined to be saved.

415
00:37:37,097 --> 00:37:40,157
It was out of your hands.

416
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:41,734
I don't believe that.

417
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:45,829
And that is what has
chained you to this place.

418
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:48,307
Accept the truth...

419
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,970
and break free.

420
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,481
You stand at the foot of the wall.

421
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:56,711
What is your next move?.

422
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:20,773
You helped him?.

423
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:24,247
Just a little.

424
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:36,191
He is ready.

425
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:09,767
Master, what is it?. What do you see?.

426
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,155
Chinou... two of them.

427
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:40,065
They advance on the sanctum.

428
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,834
They will attack
from opposite sides.

429
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:47,206
I will assemble teams.

430
00:39:47,312 --> 00:39:48,472
No, Mordo.

431
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,072
It will take all of you
to stop even one.

432
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:54,345
Begin with the nearest threat,

433
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:57,184
and then on to the next.

434
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,383
But, Master, I believe
we are strong enough

435
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:01,323
to engage them on both fronts.

436
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:07,367
Believe what you will,
but do as you are commanded.

437
00:40:12,874 --> 00:40:16,970
From here, we divide
into two teams.

438
00:40:36,335 --> 00:40:38,200
Stephen.

439
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,801
Not quitting. Just resting.

440
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:47,212
This gets more difficult
every day.

441
00:40:47,313 --> 00:40:50,214
Only as difficult as you allow.

442
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:55,581
I'd say gravity and solid mass
have a little something to say about it, too.

443
00:40:55,689 --> 00:40:59,125
You perceive these stones to be heavy.

444
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:00,819
Therefore, they are.

445
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:03,591
But to the chosen few...

446
00:41:05,935 --> 00:41:07,903
weight is meaningless.

447
00:41:08,004 --> 00:41:10,768
How do you do these things?.

448
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:14,604
By learning to accept
the unacceptable.

449
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:18,442
Pull the rope again,
and I will assist.

450
00:41:26,357 --> 00:41:27,824
Hey!

451
00:41:27,927 --> 00:41:30,327
You perceived
it was without weight,

452
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:33,421
so it became weightless.

453
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,126
Matter is energy
which is all around us.

454
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:40,570
Sorcery is simply the art
of wielding that energy.

455
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:43,142
A weapon forged from air?.

456
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:47,346
Tell me, is it real?.

457
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:49,849
Doesn't look like it.

458
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:11,866
this time, you believed it was real.

459
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:15,310
Control the forces
around your hands,

460
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:18,041
and limitations become irrelevant.

461
00:42:22,989 --> 00:42:26,083
What happened to the wall?.

462
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:29,685
You perceived it,
so it was there.

463
00:42:29,796 --> 00:42:33,163
But now you have accepted
the unacceptable,

464
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:36,396
and the wall
no longer blocks your path.

465
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:41,567
It is time you see what lies beyond.

466
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:23,822
Blue! Demara!

467
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:25,916
Throw up a containment spell!

468
00:43:35,538 --> 00:43:37,699
Mordo, their spell will not stop it!

469
00:43:37,808 --> 00:43:39,799
Tell them to move out of the way!

470
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,571
No! It will hold!

471
00:45:08,677 --> 00:45:09,769
I've got you.

472
00:45:21,192 --> 00:45:22,750
Are you all right?.

473
00:45:24,528 --> 00:45:25,961
I'll be fine.

474
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:32,870
so many innocent lives,

475
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:35,531
and four of our own.

476
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:39,133
Our brothers, our sisters...

477
00:45:39,245 --> 00:45:42,976
their bodies lie at your feet, Mordo!

478
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:44,948
We were victorious.

479
00:45:45,052 --> 00:45:47,680
The chinou was slain,
and the sanctum was defended.

480
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:48,982
I regret nothing.

481
00:45:54,362 --> 00:45:58,423
You have lost sight
of our purpose, Mordo.

482
00:45:58,534 --> 00:46:01,298
You focus only on the battle.

483
00:46:01,403 --> 00:46:05,134
But we are protectors,
not warriors.

484
00:46:05,242 --> 00:46:07,142
Yet we fight a war,

485
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:09,644
so perhaps a warrior
should take the lead.

486
00:46:09,746 --> 00:46:10,872
Mordo!

487
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,478
You feel I should step down, Mordo.

488
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:16,814
You are ill.

489
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:18,752
Your time draws near.

490
00:46:18,857 --> 00:46:20,722
I believe Dormammu
knows this,

491
00:46:20,826 --> 00:46:23,124
and it's the reason
he is making his move now.

492
00:46:23,228 --> 00:46:26,026
You may be correct,

493
00:46:26,132 --> 00:46:29,124
but the position
of sorcerer supreme

494
00:46:29,235 --> 00:46:32,432
was never destined to be yours.

495
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,873
If that was ever in question,

496
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:40,003
your recent actions
have proven this point!

497
00:46:40,115 --> 00:46:42,515
You would offer it
to someone else?.

498
00:46:42,617 --> 00:46:45,108
Who?. I deserve to know.

499
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,882
One who does not seek it.

500
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:49,821
So then what is my role here?.

501
00:46:49,926 --> 00:46:51,917
To train him.

502
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:58,467
As commanded.

503
00:47:08,146 --> 00:47:12,947
I am sorry for my part
in what has happened, Master.

504
00:47:13,052 --> 00:47:16,852
You were misled, my son.

505
00:47:16,957 --> 00:47:22,759
As for Mordo,
I fear he must be watched.

506
00:47:55,066 --> 00:47:58,968
Have you ever held a blade in your life?.

507
00:47:59,071 --> 00:48:01,562
To save lives, yes,

508
00:48:01,674 --> 00:48:03,835
but not to take them.

509
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:48,659
I'm sorry, Mordo.

510
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,193
I didn't mean to...

511
00:48:50,296 --> 00:48:51,923
You insect!

512
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,202
That's quite enough, Mordo.

513
00:49:10,985 --> 00:49:12,885
Why do you interfere?.

514
00:49:12,988 --> 00:49:16,856
You are here to train him,
not kill him.

515
00:49:20,263 --> 00:49:23,721
What good is a sorcerer supreme
who cannot defend himself?.

516
00:49:23,834 --> 00:49:25,859
What did he mean by that?.

517
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:28,233
Unimportant for now.

518
00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:32,070
What is important
is what you have just accomplished.

519
00:49:32,176 --> 00:49:34,906
Which is what, making him mad?.

520
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,573
No. That is easy.

521
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:42,382
What is difficult is your ability
to absorb Mordo's magic

522
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:44,980
and then turn it against him...

523
00:49:45,091 --> 00:49:48,390
a unique gift granted to very few.

524
00:49:48,496 --> 00:49:50,726
Mordo obviously didn't appreciate it.

525
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:55,325
Which is why I will be taking over
your training.

526
00:49:55,437 --> 00:49:57,268
No argument from me.

527
00:51:17,163 --> 00:51:19,757
Wong, what's going on?.

528
00:51:19,866 --> 00:51:21,595
The Ancient One will explain

529
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:23,100
when we reach the city.

530
00:51:23,203 --> 00:51:25,933
The city?.

531
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:28,132
But how are we going to get there?.

532
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,118
What just happened?.

533
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,852
We're here. That's all it takes.

534
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:47,054
You had me trek
all the way to Tibet

535
00:51:47,163 --> 00:51:49,188
when you had a back door
the whole time?.

536
00:51:49,299 --> 00:51:51,324
You could not have gone
this way until now.

537
00:51:51,435 --> 00:51:53,494
Come. There is more to see.

538
00:51:57,942 --> 00:52:00,809
The space we occupy here on Earth

539
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:03,040
is shared by many others...

540
00:52:03,148 --> 00:52:05,139
entire worlds.

541
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,081
We are not aware of them,

542
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:10,815
for they exist
in separate dimensions.

543
00:52:10,924 --> 00:52:12,585
However...

544
00:52:12,692 --> 00:52:15,160
each dimension has a gateway,

545
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:18,823
one that leads only to this place:

546
00:52:18,933 --> 00:52:22,801
the sanctum sanctorum.

547
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:33,280
It is called the nexus...

548
00:52:33,382 --> 00:52:37,876
the center of all other dimensions.

549
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,683
As sorcerers,

550
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,782
it has become our duty
to defend it.

551
00:52:42,894 --> 00:52:44,088
From what?.

552
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:46,186
Dormammu.

553
00:52:58,612 --> 00:53:01,775
He consists of corrupted magic,

554
00:53:01,881 --> 00:53:04,748
and dwells in the dark dimension,

555
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:09,448
a world consumed
by his brutal appetite.

556
00:53:12,094 --> 00:53:16,030
Dormammu crossed over long ago
with a legion of creatures,

557
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:18,395
and seized the nexus.

558
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,901
This gave him control
over all other dimensions.

559
00:53:22,005 --> 00:53:23,404
But you stopped him.

560
00:53:23,506 --> 00:53:26,634
Not us... the Ancient One.

561
00:53:26,744 --> 00:53:29,679
He drove Dormammu
back into his own world

562
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,543
and sealed the gateway.

563
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:33,048
And his creatures?.

564
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:36,211
We have slain all but one.

565
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,480
The wing mark.

566
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:43,892
It will only awaken on the day
of its master's return.

567
00:53:43,996 --> 00:53:45,088
Where is it now?.

568
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:48,899
On its way to the city.

569
00:53:49,002 --> 00:53:50,697
But you're pretty confident

570
00:53:50,804 --> 00:53:53,238
Dormammu can't break
through this, right?.

571
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,637
He cannot,

572
00:53:54,741 --> 00:53:59,201
but his influence on the creatures
is unmistakable.

573
00:53:59,313 --> 00:54:02,544
He is coming... somehow.

574
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:39,019
Do you feel it?.

575
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:41,594
Step away from the nexus,
Stephen.

576
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,663
But if he answers here, then we...

577
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:49,928
What was that?.

578
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:51,437
Dormammu.

579
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:54,736
I've seen that face before.

580
00:54:54,844 --> 00:54:55,833
You what?.

581
00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:56,934
Where?.

582
00:54:57,046 --> 00:55:01,380
In the hospital
when I examined a child.

583
00:55:01,485 --> 00:55:05,854
She was in a coma,
and I saw what she saw.

584
00:55:05,956 --> 00:55:07,014
A child?.

585
00:55:07,124 --> 00:55:10,491
Yes, but she wasn't the only one.

586
00:55:10,595 --> 00:55:11,960
There were many,

587
00:55:12,063 --> 00:55:14,463
all having nightmares
of that same face.

588
00:55:14,565 --> 00:55:15,964
Yes.

589
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:17,695
The answer is there.

590
00:55:17,803 --> 00:55:22,172
In dreams, the pure mind of a child
can sometimes see

591
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:24,573
through the veil
of other dimensions.

592
00:55:24,677 --> 00:55:29,740
Dormammu has found a way
to reach through that veil.

593
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:33,081
But, Ancient One,
what does this mean?.

594
00:55:33,187 --> 00:55:35,781
If enough veils are passed,

595
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:38,256
it is a way into our world:

596
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,021
through the windows of the mind.

597
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,459
We have but one option:

598
00:55:41,563 --> 00:55:44,964
kill the children before
he can come through.

599
00:55:45,067 --> 00:55:46,625
No, Mordo.

600
00:55:46,736 --> 00:55:48,670
That is never an option.

601
00:55:48,771 --> 00:55:49,669
Wait.

602
00:55:49,772 --> 00:55:52,935
If I could wake them up,
what would happen then?.

603
00:55:53,043 --> 00:55:57,207
The windows of the mind
would close.

604
00:55:57,314 --> 00:56:00,579
Go. Try.

605
00:56:00,685 --> 00:56:04,018
We will remain behind
to defend the sanctum.

606
00:56:06,525 --> 00:56:10,655
I will go with him
in case a warrior is needed.

607
00:56:10,763 --> 00:56:12,492
Here.

608
00:56:12,598 --> 00:56:15,328
I have something for you.

609
00:56:23,311 --> 00:56:24,903
Stephen?.

610
00:56:30,786 --> 00:56:32,777
The number of patients has tripled.

611
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:33,980
What are you doing?.

612
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:35,579
Checking other hospitals.

613
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,683
I want to see how widespread this is.

614
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:44,031
Every coma ward,
they're filled to capacity.

615
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:10,091
It's okay, Camille.

616
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:11,755
It's over.

617
00:57:40,732 --> 00:57:43,098
The wing mark.

618
00:57:43,201 --> 00:57:44,600
It is here.

619
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:57,908
You're safe now.

620
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:14,265
You dare enter my realm?.

621
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:17,066
I come to offer my help.

622
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:21,577
Why turn away
from the Ancient One?.

623
00:58:21,678 --> 00:58:25,614
Because the Ancient One
has turned away from me.

624
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:31,754
I could imprison you here...
like the children.

625
00:58:31,857 --> 00:58:35,190
Then Dr. Strange
would then release me,

626
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:37,023
like the children.

627
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:42,497
And what is it you offer?.

628
00:59:35,162 --> 00:59:37,130
Mordo! Something's wrong.

629
00:59:37,231 --> 00:59:40,223
I think Dormammu
is making his move.

630
00:59:45,574 --> 00:59:48,372
Mordo! We have to...

631
01:00:12,204 --> 01:00:13,330
Are you injured?.

632
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,202
I'm okay.

633
01:00:15,308 --> 01:00:16,297
What happened to Mordo?.

634
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:18,343
He has joined Dormammu.

635
01:00:57,523 --> 01:01:01,357
Miro! Adena!
The creature is upon us!

636
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,360
Prepare yourselves.

637
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:11,261
Adena, home.

638
01:02:11,373 --> 01:02:13,273
Retreat to safety.

639
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:16,242
No. I will not leave you, Master.

640
01:02:46,913 --> 01:02:52,317
I see you have found
your true place, Mordo...

641
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,878
as the lap dog of Dormammu.

642
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:10,232
Master!

643
01:03:14,979 --> 01:03:16,810
No.

644
01:03:16,914 --> 01:03:18,711
No!

645
01:03:18,816 --> 01:03:21,250
Not my master.

646
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:34,732
Wong, we have to find Mordo.

647
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:40,773
You will need the Eye... of Agamotto
to find him and his master.

648
01:03:42,476 --> 01:03:45,274
But that belongs
to the sorcerer supreme.

649
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,007
Exactly.

650
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:50,812
And with it, you can unlock the power
that dwells deep within you.

651
01:03:53,656 --> 01:03:56,454
No. Not me.

652
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:57,787
I don't want it.

653
01:03:57,894 --> 01:04:01,261
Which is why it is your destiny.

654
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:50,712
So the torch has been passed.

655
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:54,518
And now it will be extinguished!

656
01:04:57,328 --> 01:05:00,491
Not before the Ancient One is avenged.

657
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:52,013
Wong!

658
01:06:05,939 --> 01:06:09,033
Bow to the true master, Strange.

659
01:06:09,143 --> 01:06:11,134
My master is dead.

660
01:06:11,246 --> 01:06:14,306
And you will soon follow.

661
01:07:00,035 --> 01:07:02,230
You have failed me.

662
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,298
Wong!

663
01:07:29,401 --> 01:07:30,595
Go, Stephen.

664
01:07:30,703 --> 01:07:32,432
You are all that is left.

665
01:07:32,538 --> 01:07:35,006
Dormammu must be stopped!

666
01:07:51,627 --> 01:07:56,587
Come! The gateway is now open.

667
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,791
Spread into the night.

668
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:01,802
Feast! Multiply!

669
01:08:01,904 --> 01:08:06,534
For this world is ours!

670
01:08:09,647 --> 01:08:11,740
Who are you?.

671
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,408
I'm Dr. Strange,

672
01:08:13,518 --> 01:08:16,351
sorcerer supreme!

673
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:48,855
You are a child fighting a god!

674
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,862
Yes!

675
01:09:45,622 --> 01:09:46,748
Stephen, listen to me.

676
01:09:46,858 --> 01:09:50,191
Dormammu is a creature
of pure magic.

677
01:09:50,294 --> 01:09:51,420
Use that against him!

678
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:55,625
Pure magic. Pure magic!

679
01:09:59,705 --> 01:10:01,639
You wield the power of a god?.

680
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:03,732
Then give it to me... all of it!

681
01:10:06,813 --> 01:10:11,273
No! It's not possible!

682
01:11:07,115 --> 01:11:10,209
Well, that is not what I meant,

683
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:12,446
but nice work, Stephen.

684
01:11:14,357 --> 01:11:15,654
The creatures.

685
01:11:15,758 --> 01:11:17,385
They're still out there.

686
01:11:17,493 --> 01:11:21,361
And we will have long days ahead.

687
01:11:33,678 --> 01:11:34,940
Stephen?.

688
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:41,183
You look...

689
01:11:41,287 --> 01:11:42,720
You look great.

690
01:11:43,891 --> 01:11:45,518
Things have changed for me.

691
01:11:45,626 --> 01:11:48,060
I'm so glad.

692
01:11:48,161 --> 01:11:50,425
But how did you know I was here?.

693
01:11:50,531 --> 01:11:52,863
You always come here, Gina.

694
01:11:52,967 --> 01:11:54,832
Wait. Your hand.

695
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,528
It's healed. How did i...

696
01:11:56,638 --> 01:11:58,265
It's a long story.

697
01:11:58,374 --> 01:12:02,310
But I want you to know
that you were right.

698
01:12:02,411 --> 01:12:04,743
It is time I start giving back.

699
01:12:04,848 --> 01:12:06,907
I don't understand.

700
01:12:07,017 --> 01:12:09,212
You will.

701
01:12:10,253 --> 01:12:11,743
Stephen?.

702
01:12:32,345 --> 01:12:33,778
Are you all right?.

703
01:12:34,982 --> 01:12:36,472
Yes.

704
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:37,777
I am.

705
01:12:43,191 --> 01:12:44,590
How's the scouting been going?.

706
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:47,059
Very good.

707
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,790
I have discovered
several new prospects...

708
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:52,595
young, but very promising.

709
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,863
One in particular...

710
01:12:54,972 --> 01:12:57,440
a woman named Clea.
